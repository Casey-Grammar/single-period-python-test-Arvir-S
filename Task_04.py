# Task 04 - Expand Subject Codes
# Write a function called expand_subject_codes(codes)
# that takes a list of short subject codes and returns a new list
# with the full subject names.
#
# Use the following code table:
# ENG -> English
# MAT -> Mathematics
# SCI -> Science
# HIS -> History
# ART -> Art
#
# If a code is not recognised, ignore it.
#
# Example:
# expand_subject_codes(["MAT", "SCI", "XYZ", "ENG"])
# returns ["Mathematics", "Science", "English"]

def expand_subject_codes(codes):
    # Write your code here
    subject_map = {
        "ENG": "English",
        "MAT": "Mathematics",
        "SCI": "Science",
        "HIS": "History",
        "ART": "Art"
    }
    expanded_list = []
   
    for code in codes:
        # If the code exists in our dictionary, add its value to the new list
        if code in subject_map:
            expanded_list.append(subject_map[code])
           
    return expanded_list

    pass
